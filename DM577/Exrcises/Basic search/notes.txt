Give a complete problem formulation for each of the following problems. Choose a formulation
that is precise enough to be implemented.

Problem formulation:
    - State space   (all posiable states)
    - Initial state (the state were we start)
    - Goal state(s) (where we want to do/end)
    - Transition model  (What action each state can do and what it does)
    - Cost model    (How good each action is)

(a) There are six glass boxes in a row, each with a lock. Each of the first five boxes holds a key
unlocking the next box in line; the last box holds a banana. You have the key to the first box,
and you want the banana.

Our solution to the problem:
    - State space: A list of keys and a banana.
    - Initial state: A key.
    - Goal state: Have a banana.
    - Transition model: Use a key to open a new box.
    - Cost model: All actions cost something... times key used.
Luis' solution:
    - State space: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    - Initial state: 0
    - Goal state: 6
    - Transition model: +1
    - Cost model: 1

(b) You start with the sequence ABABAECCEC, or in general any sequence made from A, B, C,
and E. You can transform this sequence using the following equalities: AC = E, AB = BC,
BB = E, and Ex = x for any x. For example, ABBC can be transformed into AEC, and then
AC, and then E. Your goal is to produce the sequence E.

    - State space: {A, B, C, E}.
    - Initial state: "ABABAECCEC".
    - Goal state(s): "E".
    - Transition model: Use one rules on the String.
    - Cost model: 1 per action.



(c) There is an n × n grid of squares, each square initially being either unpainted floor or a
bottomless pit. You start standing on an unpainted floor square, and can either paint the
square under you or move onto an adjacent unpainted floor square. You want the whole floor
painted.

(d) A container ship is in port, loaded high with containers. There 13 rows of containers, each
13 containers wide and 5 containers tall. You control a crane that can move to any location
above the ship, pick up the container under it, and move it onto the dock. You want the ship
unloaded.

(e) Using only four colors, you have to color a planar map in such a way that no two adjacent
regions have the same color.

(f) A 3-foot-tall monkey is in a room where some bananas are suspended from the 8-foot ceiling.
He would like to get the bananas. The room contains two stackable, movable, climbable
3-foot-high crates.

(g) You have a program that outputs the message “illegal input record” when fed a certain file of
input records. You know that processing of each record is independent of the other records.
You want to discover what record is illegal.
(h) You have three jugs, measuring 12 liters, 8 liters, and 3 liters, and a water faucet. You can fill
the jugs up or empty them out from one to another or onto the ground. You need to measure
out exactly one liter.
