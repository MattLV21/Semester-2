Problem solven agent: search for
a sequence of actions that leads to 
the goal.

Focus on enverment that are:
    - Single agent
    - determanextic
    - epictic
    - static
    - fully observable
    - dinamic

Four stage plan:
    1) Goal formulation
    2) Problem formulation
    3) search for a solution
    4) execute the solution

Problem formulation:
    - State space   (all posiable states)
    - Initial state (the state were we start)
    - Goal state(s) (where we want to do/end)
    - Transition model  (What action each state can do and what it does)
    - Cost model    (How good each action is)

Examble:
Train in Denmark.
State space = all train stations in denmark
Initial state = which station we start at
goal state = the station we want to go to
transition model = the difrent trains we can take
cost model = how good each train is

lets say we are at Korsør st and want to go to Odense st.
Initial sstate is Korsør st
goal state is Odense
Transition model will be all stops from Korsør til København st and Aarhus st
cost model will be København cost alot and Aarhus will be good.

Search tree:
    - root : initial node
    - edges : transitions

Search algoretmers choose which node to expand next
These nodes are storaged in a (prioridty) queue

Evelution of search algoretmers
    -> completenes
    -> cost optimality
    -> time complexity
    -> space complexity
