Uninformed search algorithm

Week 7 part 1 search algorithm
1) Breath-first search
    - use a queue for unexparned nodes.
    - always complete
    - cost-optimal if all actions have the same cost.
    - themille memory consumption.
    - ealy goal test

2) Uniform cost-search (Dy)
    - sprt nodes bt total cost.
    - use priority queue.
    - late goal test.

3) depth-first search
    - use a static for unexparned nodes.
    - in general not complete.
    - in general not cost-optimal.
    - low memory.

Week 7 part 2 search algorithm
Iterative depthing
    - perform bounded depth-first search.
    - if no solution is found increace the bound and try again.

Bidirectional search
    - search from the inetial state and from the goal state.
    - when you find a common state, there is asolution.
